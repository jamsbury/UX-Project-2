Graduates are prepared for careers in graphic design, web design, multimedia design, advertising, printing, publishing or related fields. Theory and practice are covered in a variety of contexts, including process and product, form and content, type and image and inter activity. Current technology and future trends are addressed in the context of industry practices. Learn to depict the size and shape of objects, the basic design concepts for 2 dimensional works, and how to manipulate letterform for communicative purposes. Begin the lifelong process of refining your creative and perceptual problem solving skills through this series of core classes. You will combine theoretical study with applied projects to develop a visual and verbal vocabulary for the creation of complex, yet cohesive visual systems.\n\n"
